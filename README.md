# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
In this notebook, I worked by myself based on a project of the Kaggle website: 

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

My works include two principal parts:

+ Data visulisation, and

+ Predicting the house's price by using the three models including Linear regression, Gradient Boosting (GBM) regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost) regression.
